  # Description

  Working with SQL is hard, and it gets confusing easily. I want to access and edit data in my database, which contains info on my departments, roles, and employees in my business. Thanks to SQL Database Manager, its as easy as pressing buttons!

  ## Installation

  First, download the project to your system. Once done, install its dependencies - namely MySQL. Log into MySQL and source the 'schema.sql' and 'seeds.sql' files, in that order. Once thats done, go into the .env file downloaded with this program. Change the 'PASSWORD' variable to your MySQL password, and then run the program by entering node index into the command line.

  ## Usage

  Simply use the arrow keys to select what option you would like to use, and follow its instructions.
